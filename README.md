# Sign-Up Form Project

## Overview
This project is part of the **Intermediate HTML and CSS Course** and involves creating a sign-up form for an imaginary service. It helps solidify skills in structuring a webpage with HTML and styling it with CSS. The project also includes the use of assets such as images and logos to create a visually appealing form.

## Features
- A background image with a semi-transparent dark overlay behind the "ODIN" logo to improve text readability.
- A sign-up form with the following input fields:
  - First Name
  - Last Name
  - Email
  - Phone Number
  - Password
  - Confirm Password
- A "Create Account" button styled to match the tones of the background image (#596D48).
- Input validation using CSS pseudo-classes:
  - **`:invalid`** for displaying a red border on invalid password fields.
  - **`:focus`** for applying a blue border and subtle box-shadow to focused inputs.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: To structure the webpage and form elements.
- **CSS3**: To style the form, including:
  - Borders and box shadows.
  - Semi-transparent overlays.
  - Hover and focus effects.
- **Assets**: Images and logos included to enhance the design.

## Implementation Steps
1. **HTML Structure**:
   - Scaffold the structure of the page, including a `div` for the logo area and a form with labeled input fields.

2. **CSS Styling**:
   - Style the `div` behind the "ODIN" logo with a semi-transparent dark background.
   - Add default styles for inputs with a light border (#E5E7EB).
   - Use the `:invalid` pseudo-class to apply red borders to invalid password fields.
   - Use the `:focus` pseudo-class to apply blue borders and a subtle box-shadow to focused inputs.
   - Style the "Create Account" button with the color #596D48 and hover effects.

3. **Assets**:
   - Include images and logos to enhance the design.
   - Use external fonts where necessary.

## How to Use
1. Clone or download the project files.
2. Open the `index.html` file in any modern browser to view the sign-up form.
3. Interact with the form to see the different input states (default, focused, invalid).

## Future Enhancements
- Add JavaScript validation to ensure the password and confirm password fields match.
- Make the design responsive for better usability on mobile devices.
- Add real-time feedback for form validation.
